# Attend, Infer, Repeat in web browser

Live JavaScript-based [in-browser demo](https://aakhundov.github.io/airdemo/) of "Attend, Infer, Repeat" - unsupervised scene understanding model by [Eslami et al., 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08575). Draw digits in the left canvas, clear with a right click. On startup the demo downloads ~5MB of model parameters.

Implemented using [deeplearn.js](https://deeplearnjs.org), with the trained model parameters values obtained from [this implementation](https://github.com/aakhundov/tf-attend-infer-repeat) of AIR. This is a work in progress, some GUI and additional features are yet to be added.
